# Expense GQL

Expense GQL is an expense management application that allows users to track their expenses, categorize them, and generate reports. It is built using GraphQL for the API layer and React for the frontend.

The goal of this project was to create a full-stack application that demonstrates the use of GraphQL for data fetching and management, as well as React for building a dynamic user interface.
