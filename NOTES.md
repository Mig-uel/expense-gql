# GraphQL Package

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST.
- It is the core GraphQL implementation in JavaScript, allowing you to define your schema, resolve functions, and execute queries.
- It provides the functionality to define GraphQL schemas, parse and validate queries, and execute them against your schema.
- GraphQL is not tied to any specific server or client framework; it is a standalone library that be used with any JavaScript environment.
- It is often used in conjunction with other libraries like Apollo Server or Express to create a complete GraphQL server.
- GraphQL allows you to define your data types, relationships, and operations in a single schema file, making it easier to manage and evolve your API over time.

## @apollo/server

- Apollo Server is a community-driven, open-source GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema.
- This package is part of the Apollo ecosystem, and is used for building GraphQL servers in Node.js.
- It provides tools and utilities for creating and managing a GraphQL server, including schema definition, query execution, and middleware integration.
- This package is built on top of the popular `express` framework, making it easy to integrate GraphQL into existing Express applications.
- Overall, it simplifies the process of setting up a GraphQL server and provides a robust set of features for building GraphQL APIs.

## What is a GraphQL Schema?

- A GraphQL schema is a blueprint for your GraphQL API. It defines the types of data that can be queried, the relationships between those types, and the operations (queries and mutations) that can be performed on that data.
- The schema is written in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), which is a simple and intuitive syntax for defining types, fields, and relationships.
- It is a fundamental concept in GraphQL, as it provides a clear contract between the client and server, allowing clients to understand what data is available and how to access it.
- The schema is typically defined in a single file, which can be imported and used by the GraphQL server to handle incoming queries and mutations.
- The schema can be extended and modified over time, allowing you to add new types, fields, and operations as your application evolves.
- Again, it defined the structure of the data that clients can query and the operations that they can perform on that data.
- A schema consists of two main components: typeDefs and resolvers.

## What are TypeDefs (Type Definitions)?

- TypeDefs are the definitions of the types in your GraphQL schema. They define the structure of the data that can be queried and the relationships between those types.
- TypeDefs are written in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL), which is a simple and intuitive syntax for defining types, fields, and relationships.
- They are used to define the types of data that can be queried, the fields that are available on those types, and the relationships between those types.
- Type definitions define the shape of the data available in the GraphQL API. They specify the types of objects that can be queried, the fields on those objects, and the relationships between them.

## What are Resolvers?

- Resolvers are functions that are responsible for fetching the data for a specific field in your GraphQL schema.
- They are used to implement the logic for how to fetch the data for a specific field in your schema.
- Resolvers are typically defined as part of the schema, and they are executed when a query is made to the GraphQL server.
- They are responsible for resolving the data for a specific field in your schema, based on the query that was made.
- In simpler terms, resolvers are functions that take the arguments from a query and return the data for that field. They determine how to fetch the data associated with each field in the schema.
